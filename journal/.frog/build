I practiced my problem solving skill in the lab. This was done by having to fill in the blanks in the code. This was done for part 4 of the <a href=\"http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/labs/L07/\">lab</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>\n\n<p>Some of the things that I found really interesting is the lab was using <code>match</code>. This was really interesting to me because it was something I have not seen before. It was a cool concept to look at another way to use something similar to <code>cons</code> for lists.</p>\n\n<h2>What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>\n\n<p>The first thing we had to do in the lab is read a few links to get some background.  Then we looked at \n <b>macros</b>. During this section we looked at redefining <code>and</code> and redefining <code>or</code>.  Then we looked at \n <b>pattern matching</b>. Here we used match with maps and looked at <code>Let</code> and <code>Let *</code>.  Then we looked at \n <b>list transformers to macros</b>. During this part of the lab we looked at reading a list in a macro.</p>")) ((p+ #"/home/student/fcshome/cs2613/journal/_src/posts/2019-09-24-lab6.md" . unix) f post (u .

Then we used JavaScript to translate some Racket expressions. Then finally we looked at two coding problems in JavaScript.</p>") #f (u . "\n<h2>What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>\n\n<p>This lab was mainly focused around JavaScript. JavaScript was a new language for me to learn today. In the lab it was really helpful to have the background knowledge of Java because it made things a lot easier to understand. It was also helpful knowing racket because there was a lot of shortcut ways of do things that you could not do in Java.   \n <h2>What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>  There was nothing that I knew from the past used that was used in this lab. However my knowledge of Java really helped to understand JavaScript a lot easier. It also helped me pick up on the JavaScript syntax.   \n <h2>What new skills did you practice?</h2> Some new skills I practiced today was using debugging in JavaScript. Another skill I practiced was coding in JavaScript. The skills I practiced today are going to become helpful throughout the course as we more more into JavaScript stuff.   \n <h2>What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2> In this lab, I found the \n <b>VSCodium</b> really interesting. It seems like it would be very handy to debug the JavaScript in. I also found trying to solve the JavaScript problems really interesting. It was interesting to see the different ways that they could be solved.   \n <h2>What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2> In this lab we started working with JavaScript. First we started with understanding a little about JavaScript by reading a few different links posted in the lab. Then there was a demonstration on how to use VSCodium. During the demonstration we were also shown that in order to run JavaScript through the terminal, we use <code>node hello-world.js</code> . Then we used JavaScript to translate some Racket expressions. Then finally we looked at two coding problems in JavaScript.</p>")) ((p+ #"/home/student/fcshome/cs2613/journal/_src/posts/2019-10-08-lab-9.md" . unix) f post (u .

This concepts covered in the lab was all new concept from me.</p>\n\n<h3>JavaScript</h3>\n\n<p>In this lab we looked at creating functions in JavaScript and using modules. This was an interesting section because it a lot of things were very similar to racket and java. Creating functions was very similar to the way they are done in java. Creating the modules were very similar to the way it was done in racket.</p>\n\n<h3>Jasmine</h3>\n\n<p>The next new thing we covered was jasmine. This is a unit testing tool that is used. This was a very interesting thing to cover because it is always nice to find other tools that can be used to help test the code.</p>\n\n<h2>What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>\n\n<p>There was nothing that was too familiar in this lab. The structure of JavaScript was familiar from racket and java. This familiar structure made it easier to gain a basic understanding of javascript.  I was also familiar with recursion from the past coding languages. Having the past knowledge made applying recursion in java script a lot easier to understand.</p>\n\n<h2>What new skills did you practice?</h2>\n\n<p>Some new skills I practiced was coding in JavaScript and testing through different tools.  The skills in JavaScript was practiced by having the whole lab be based on coding in Javascript.  The testing skills were practiced by using jasmine to run different test cases. What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important? I found the close similarities to Java and racket very interesting. It made the process of learning the new language a lot easier to begin.</p>\n\n<h2>What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>\n\n<p>First we looked at the \n <b>JavaScript equality</b> and type coercion. During this we looked different statements that use <code>==</code> and looked at the results.  Then we looked at \n <b>JavaScript functions</b>. We read <a href=\"http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html\">JavaScript function</a> to help gain a better understanding of what they are.These are outlined very similar to the way the functions that are in Java which made it easier to understand.  After we looked at \n <b>Node.js modules</b>. This was a very similar way of setting up modules as racket did. For this section we quickly read <a href=\"http://eloquentjavascript.net/10_modules.html\">chapter 10</a> of the JavaScript book to gain a better understanding of modules in JavaScript. After we looked at Jasmine. First I read the <a href=\"https://jasmine.github.io/index.html\">documentation</a> and the <a href=\"https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite\">tutorial</a> to git better understanding of how the unit testing framework.
