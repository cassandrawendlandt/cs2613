This was an interesting topic because I never knew about it.

This reading was very helpful in the lab to explain topics I was having problems with.  First we copied the python code from <a href=\"http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/labs/L14/_humansize.py/\">humansize.py</a> and ran it from the command line using <code>python3 humansize.py</code>.

We first copied the <a href=\"http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/labs/L14/_test_humansize.py/\">initial test cases</a>that were given during the lab. We ran the test cases in the terminal by using <code>pytest-3</code>. Then we ran it through vscodium but adding the <code>Python: Configure Tests</code> in the terminal then we were able to run the test cases.  After we moved onto looking at modules in python. Here we saw that if we want a function from a file we can add <code>from humansize import approximate size</code>. Then if we want to be able to access all the functions in a file we add <code>import humansize</code>.  The last two topics we looked at was <strong>indentation</strong> and <strong>expectations</strong> in python. For the indentation section we looked at the FizzBuzz problem and added the indentations so the code will run properly. After that we looked at expectations.

It was really interesting to learn how to combine Racket into the document. Using both Racket and scribble to create a document would be a good way to help save some work.

We went through this example as group and discussed each of the lines a bit. Then we looked at <strong>stripping quotes</strong>. In this section we took what we talked about regular expression and put it into practice. Some of the documents we read in this section was on <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects\">groups</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax\">regular expression syntax</a>from the python documentation. Then we looked at <strong>handling quoted comma</strong>. In this section we completed the definition of <code>split_row_3</code> that was given in the lab. The code was suppose to add the strings into 3 different columns then remove the commas.

I found this an extremely helpful tool to use. Being able to see what lines of code were used for a test case is very helpful in debugging. I found that looking at the unused line of code after a test case is found made debugging a lot easier. It saved me a lot time because I no longer had to insert print statements to see where the code was going, I was just able to look at the lines the code to see what was and was not entered.</p>\n\n<h2>What new skills did you practice?</h2>\n\n<p>The new skill that I practised during the lab was my debugging skills in Racket. During the lab we were taught helpful tools to test the code in Racket. By having to fix the code and make sure all the test cases passed allowed me to gain some practice using them.</p>\n\n<h2>What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>\n\n<p>There are a few things during the lab that I found interesting. The first one was using the first and rest functions. I found them interesting because I have always struggled with recursion functions but using first and rest made recursion a lot easier to understand and solve the problem.</p>\n\n<h2>What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>\n\n<p>Throughout the lab there was a few different things I read to help gain a better understanding.</p>\n\n<p>One thing that I read was documentation on <a href=\"https://beautifulracket.com/explainer/unit-testing.html\">Unit testing in racket</a>. This helped me understand the different things that I needed to know in order to complete the unit testing on the lab. It gave a nice explanation on how to be able to run the test cases.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing I read was the documentation on <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Debugging-with-Git\">debugging with Git</a>. This was a helpful document to read to understand on what the lab instructions meant.</p>")) ((p+ #"/home/student/fcshome/cs2613/journal/_src/posts/2019-10-08-lab-10.md" . unix) f post (u .
