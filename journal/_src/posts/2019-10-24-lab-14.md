##What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?
One new concepts I learnt this was testing in python. Today I learnt about the tool called [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) that is used to test the code. This is a similar concept to the testing tool we used in JavaScript called `jasmine`. This was nice because it made it easier to understand pytest in the beginning. 

##What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?
The concept that was familiar to me was coding in Python since I already took a course on it.  This made it easy to follow along in the lab and understand what was happening. 

##What new skills did you practice?
In this lab I did not practice any new skills. However I practice so existing skills. One skill that I improved on was my testing skills. In the lab I learnt a new tool to help me test python code. I improved my python skills as well since the lab was just coding in python. 

##What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?
An interesting topic in today's lab was the **pytest**. This was an interesting topic because I never knew about it. This functions appears to make testing the files so much easier than when I had to do it in other courses. 

##What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?
We were given [chapter 1](http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/your-first-python-program.html#everythingisanobject) in **Dive into Python 3** to read for the lab. This reading was very helpful in the lab to explain topics a little more if I was confused on anything. 
First we copied the python code [humansize.py](http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/labs/L14/_humansize.py/) and ran it from the command line using `python3 humansize.py`. Then we ran them through the terminal using `python3` and typed in lines to run the function. 
Then we moved to writing test cases using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/). We first copied the [initial test cases](http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/labs/L14/_test_humansize.py/)that were given during the lab. We ran the test cases in the terminal by using `pytest-3`. Then we ran it through vscodium but adding the `Python: Configure Tests` in the terminal then we were able to run the test cases. 
After we moved onto looking at modules in python. Here we saw that if we just want a function from a file we can add `from humansize import approximate size`. Then if we want to be able to access all the functions in a file we add `import humansize`. 
The last two topics we looked at was **indentation** and **expectations** in python. For the indentation section we looked at the FizzBuzz problem and added the indentations so the code will run properly. After that we looked at expectations. In this section we had to fix the function to make it check so it does not divide by 0.
