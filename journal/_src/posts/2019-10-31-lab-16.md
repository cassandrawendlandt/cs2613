##What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?

###Map
Today we talked what [map](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map) does in python. It acts similar to the map we saw in racket which made it easier to understand. It was a little confusing to understand at the beginning but the [following link](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_map.asp) really helped to understand it a lot more.

###Format
The other new concept we covered today in the lab was [format strings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format). This concept seemed a lot similar to the format in c. This was helpful to gain a better understanding of what was going on.

##What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?
Most of this lab was familiar to me because I have already worked with it in a previous class. I also worked with a lot of the topics in the lab for the assignment as well. This was helpful because I picked up on some tips I can use in the assignment to improve my code.

##What new skills did you practice?
During the lab I did not practice any new skills but I did improve on skills that I already have. The first skill I improved on was my python coding skills. This skill was improved because the whole lab was programming in python. The next skill I improved on was my problem solving skills. I improved this skill because a good chunk of the lab was working by yourself.

##What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?
I found that the lab was pretty easy overall. There were some spots that I found hard to get like the map question. The rest I had a pretty good understanding before the lab so it made it easy to follow along and gain more from the lab as well.

##What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?
During this lab we started by looking at [list comprehensions](http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/comprehensions.html#listcomprehension). First we had to fill in the blank of the missing code.Then we moved onto [dictionary comprehensions](http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/comprehensions.html#dictionarycomprehension) . This section was fairly familiar with since I used in the assignment already. In this part of the lab we had to turn a list into a dictionary. The line of code I used to complete this was `{i+1: lst[i] for i in range ( 0 , len (lst))}` but then after having a discussion I found a more concise way of writing the same line. The better way to write this is `{i+1: lst[i] for i in range ( len (lst))}`.
