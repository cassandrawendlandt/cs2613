<h2 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<h3 id="regular-expression">Regular Expression</h3>

<p>During this section of the lab we looked at how regular expressions worked. We followed the <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/regular-expressions.html#streetaddresses">example</a> for the textbook. This example helped make regular expression much easier to understand. In the demo we ran <code>re.sub('Road$','RD.',s)</code>. This little section of the code looks in the string s, and tries to find &lsquo;Road&rsquo;. The dollar signs make it so that &lsquo;Road&rsquo; has to be at the end of the string. Once &lsquo;Road&rsquo; is found then it will replace it with &lsquo;RD.&rsquo;. The quick demo made it much easier to understand regular expression. Another thing that really helped to understand the regular expressions was reading <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/regular-expressions.html">chapter5</a> of the book <strong>Dive Into Python 3</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="stripping-quotes">Stripping Quotes</h3>

<p>This section of the lab builds off the previous section.This section we used regular expressions to remove all the <strong>""</strong> that may be in a string. During this part there was a lot of new concepts introduced like the <code>[^"]</code> is a character class. This section of the lab was a bit difficult to understand at the beginning. Once the topics were explained a bit more in details it was a little easier to understand. The</p>

<h3 id="handling-quoted-commas">Handling Quoted Commas</h3>

<p>During this section of the lab we worked on creating a function that will break things up into three different columns. This section of the lab was pretty tricky to understand at the beginning. A document that really helped me understand the topic a lot more was from the textbook <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/regular-expressions.html#verbosere">Dive Into Python 3</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>One of the familiar topics in today&rsquo;s lab was splitting strings. This was familiar for a course I took last year. At the beginning I had a hard to remembering how <code>split</code> and <code>splitlines</code> work. After looking at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp">split</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_splitlines.asp">splitlines</a> I was able to complete the section of the lab without any problem.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>Some of the new skills I practiced during the lab was using regular expressions. I also improved on my python coding skills because the whole lab was programming in python. During the lab I also improved on my debugging skills and problem solving skills. This was improved by having to examine the different errors my code was throwing and trying to figure out how to fix them.</p>

<h2 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>During the lab one of the easiest topics cover was <strong>splitting strings</strong>. This was easier because I already had some experience working with them. The topics on <strong>regular expressions</strong> were a bit more tricky to follow and understand at the beginning.</p>

<h2 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>In the lab we first worked with <strong>splitting strings</strong>. In this section of the lab we had to separate strings when a comma appears. Then we moved on to working with <strong>regular expressions</strong>. In this section we looked at an <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/regular-expressions.html#streetaddresses">example</a> from <strong>Dive Into Python 3</strong>. We went through this example as group and discussed each of the lines a bit. Then we looked at <strong>stripping quotes</strong>. In this section we took what we talked about regular expression and put it into practice. Some of the documents we read in this section was on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects">groups</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax">regular expression syntax</a>from the python documentation. Then we looked at <strong>handling quoted comma</strong>. In this section we completed the definition of <code>split_row_3</code> that was given in the lab. The code was suppose to add the strings into 3 different columns then remove the commas. During this section we read the document on <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/regular-expressions.html#verbosere">verbose reqular expressions</a> from <strong>Dive Into Python 3</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h1>

<h2 id="map">Map</h2>

<p>Today we talked what <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map">map</a> does in python. It acts similar to the map we saw in racket which made it easier to understand. It was a little confusing to understand at the beginning but the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_map.asp">following link</a> really helped to understand it a lot more.</p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>

<p>The other new concept we covered today in the lab was <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format">format strings</a>. This concept seemed a lot similar to the format in c. This was helpful to gain a better understanding of what was going on.</p>

<h1 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h1>

<p>Most of this lab was familiar to me because I have already worked with it in a previous class. I also worked with a lot of the topics in the lab for the assignment as well. This was helpful because I picked up on some tips I can use in the assignment to improve my code.</p>

<h1 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h1>

<p>During the lab I did not practice any new skills but I did improve on skills that I already have. The first skill I improved on was my python coding skills. This skill was improved because the whole lab was programming in python. The next skill I improved on was my problem solving skills. I improved this skill because a good chunk of the lab was working by yourself.</p>

<h1 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h1>

<p>I found that the lab was pretty easy overall. There were some spots that I found hard to get like the map question. The rest I had a pretty good understanding before the lab so it made it easy to follow along and gain more from the lab as well.</p>

<h1 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h1>

<p>During this lab we started by looking at <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/comprehensions.html#listcomprehension">list comprehensions</a>. First we had to fill in the blank of the missing code.Then we moved onto <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/comprehensions.html#dictionarycomprehension">dictionary comprehensions</a> . This section was fairly familiar with since I used in the assignment already. In this part of the lab we had to turn a list into a dictionary. The line of code I used to complete this was <code>{i+1: lst[i] for i in range ( 0 , len (lst))}</code> but then after having a discussion I found a more concise way of writing the same line. The better way to write this is <code>{i+1: lst[i] for i in range ( len (lst))}</code>.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<h3 id="global-variables-from-files">Global variables from files</h3>

<p>In this lab I learnt that you could use a global variable from the file for the test cases or in other files. To import a global variable the line of code we used was <code>from filename import variable</code>. This would make testing easier when it is hard to return variables that depends on what was called in the past.</p>

<h3 id="pytest-commands">Pytest commands</h3>

<p>In this lab we learnt some new commands that will show the coverage of the python program. The first new one we looked at was <code>pytest-3 --cov = rpn</code>. This command will produce a summary of the statements in the file rpn. It will provide the number of statements that were missed if there is any. It will also tell you the percentage of coverage for the file. The other pytest command we looked at was <code>pytest-3 --cov=rpn --cov-report=term-missing</code>. This command will display all the same information as the previous one but it also list any lines that were missed.</p>

<h2 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>The most familiar concept for this lab was programming in python. The overall base of the lab was really easy to follow along with since I already had a base knowledge in python from a previous course.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>There was not any new skills that I really practiced. However, I did improve on my testing skills. This was done by learning the pytest commands. Knowing these commands will help ensure that I can get full coverage.</p>

<h2 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>In today’s lab I found the new commands for pytest to be the most interesting. I think the pytest commands were the most interesting because it will be very helpful later on when checking for full test coverage. I also found the lab easy to follow along which was really nice because it allowed me to be able to focus more on what was being said.</p>

<h2 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>First we looked at the <strong>reverse polish notation calculator</strong> problem described in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">wikipedia</a>. Then we started programming it. First we got the stack set up to store the numbers. Then we looked at the different pytest commands that may become helpful in test. Then we moved on to adding <code>if elif else</code> to the function to test if any arithmetic needs to be done. Once that was done we looked at improving the robustness of the tests. In this section of the lab we added and <code>elif</code> to the method to handle when <code>"clear”</code> is passed through. When clear is passed through it will empty the stack of numbers. Then we added <code>elif</code> to check for <code>"dup” “pop” “swap”</code>. Once we got those methods implemented we added an <code>elif</code> to check to see if <code>”print”</code> is passed through then prints the last element in the stack. Then we worked added a method to handle if a string of operations is passed through to go through and complete them in order.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<p>One new concepts I learnt this lab was testing in python. Today I learnt about the tool called <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a> that is used to test the code. This is a similar concept to the testing tool we used in JavaScript called <code>jasmine</code>. This was nice because it made it easier to understand pytest in the beginning.</p>

<h2 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>The concept that was familiar to me was coding in Python since I already took a course on it. This made it easy to follow along in the lab and understand what was happening.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>In this lab I did not practice any new skills. However I practice so existing skills. One skill that I improved on was my testing skills. In the lab I learnt how pytest worked to be able to use it to test the code created. I improved my python programming skills as well since the lab was an introduction to coding in python.</p>

<h2 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>An interesting topic in today&rsquo;s lab was the <strong>pytest</strong>. This was an interesting topic because I never knew about it. This functions appears to make testing python files a lot easier than when I had to do it in other courses.</p>

<h2 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>We were given <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/your-first-python-program.html#everythingisanobject">chapter 1</a> in <strong>Dive into Python 3</strong> to read for the lab. This reading was very helpful in the lab to explain topics I was having problems with.  First we copied the python code from <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/labs/L14/_humansize.py/">humansize.py</a> and ran it from the command line using <code>python3 humansize.py</code>. Then we ran them through the terminal using <code>python3</code> and typed in lines to run the function.  Then we moved to writing test cases using <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a>. We first copied the <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/labs/L14/_test_humansize.py/">initial test cases</a>that were given during the lab. We ran the test cases in the terminal by using <code>pytest-3</code>. Then we ran it through vscodium but adding the <code>Python: Configure Tests</code> in the terminal then we were able to run the test cases.  After we moved onto looking at modules in python. Here we saw that if we want a function from a file we can add <code>from humansize import approximate size</code>. Then if we want to be able to access all the functions in a file we add <code>import humansize</code>.  The last two topics we looked at was <strong>indentation</strong> and <strong>expectations</strong> in python. For the indentation section we looked at the FizzBuzz problem and added the indentations so the code will run properly. After that we looked at expectations. In this section we had to fix the function to make it check so it does not divide by 0.</p>

<h1 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h1>

<p>During this lab we looked at <strong>timers</strong> and <strong>animations</strong>. These were fairly new topics to me as I have not seen them much. It was really neat to see how the animation ran while using the robot example from <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/labs/L12/">lab 12</a>. Setting the time interval was a brand new concept to me. Using the <code>timer = setInterval (frame, 300)</code> seemed a lot easier to understand than the <code>setTimeout(function () {loop (i-1, str+”*”): }, 1000);</code> to understand. It seemed easier to understand because you can easily place what is what by looking at it right away. They only bad thing about it, is that you need to remember to have a <code>clearInterval</code> so it does not run forever.</p>

<h1 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h1>

<p>There was not any concepts that I was familiar with from other courses or my own knowledge this time around.</p>

<h1 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h1>

<p>The new skills that I practiced was my debugging skills, JavaScript programming skills, and problem solving skills. I practiced my debugging skills by having to work through the errors that was given and try to fix them. There were a few problems that I could not get so I asked my classmates and they helped solve them and showed me new debugging techniques. By working with through my problems and getting my classmates help I practiced my problem solving skills. I improved my JavaScript coding skills since the whole lab was completed in JavaScript.</p>

<h1 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h1>

<p>I found the animation part of the lab to be very interesting. It was cool to see a visual representation of the robot moving around the screen. I found this interesting because I find anything that is interactive or just constantly active for a set time to be very interesting.</p>

<h1 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h1>

<p>First we looked at <strong>timers</strong>. We had to run the provided code. While doing this we noticed that it was not 100 % correct since all done was being printed before the animation is actually complete. We then had to make changes to the code in order for it to work properly. The changes we made was putting the print statement into an else statement with the timer.  Then we implemented another timer. This one did not use recursion like the previous one.  After that the lab was just about setting up the <strong>animation</strong> for the robot exercise that is in <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/07_robot.html">chapter 7</a> of Eloquent JavaScript and from last lab as well.</p>

<h1 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h1>

<p>This lab was mainly about completing the project The Robot from <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/07_robot.html">Chapter 7</a> of the Eloquent JavaScript. We were introduced to <strong>Spy</strong> to use it as as tool to intercept calls to <code>console.log</code> . Spy is to be used when methods are terrible to test because they do not return anything. This allows you to be able to test the source code without actually changing the source code. Spys essentially replaces <code>console.log</code>. Another new concept was <code>class</code> in JavaScript. They seem to work very similar was the classes in java which made it easier to understand what is going on.</p>

<h1 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h1>

<p>There was not a lot of concepts that were familiar from other course or from my own knowledge.</p>

<h1 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h1>

<p>I did not practice any new skills. However I did practice writing test cases in jasmine. I did this by having to write the test cases for each method that was added to ensure it worked.</p>

<h1 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h1>

<p>I found the ideas about spy’s to be pretty interesting. I found them to be interesting because it was a different way to test functions that did not return anything. They seem like they would be useful in testing things later on.</p>

<h1 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h1>

<p>First we started with representing a graph. This was done by going to <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/07_robot.html#h_UmFK5fYed8">Meadowfield</a> and copying the code. Then we created jasmine test cases to test the code that we copied. Then we copy the <code>VillageState</code> class from <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/07_robot.html#h_oekYfM5x02">Eloquent JavaScript</a>. Next we created jasmine test cases for the class. In order to do this we took the suggested output from chapter 7 and converted it into jasmine test cases. We had to add some extra cases in order to get full test coverage. Next we moved on to work with Spy’s. We read the <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite#section-Spies:_%3Ccode%3EcreateSpy%3C/code%3E">documentation</a> on it quickly. We used spy’s to test the random robot section of the code.</p>

<h1 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h1>

<h2 id="array-methods">Array methods</h2>

<p>Looking at Array methods we learnt that they have higher order functions that can be really useful. Learning these functions ended up being useful for working with larger lists. For example using <code>reduced</code> and an anonymous function to calculate the average of a list. Another array method that was new for me was <code>forEach</code>. This method gives the users to iterate over a list with an arbitrary action without fussing with loops indices and bounds.</p>

<h2 id="json-parsing">Json parsing</h2>

<p>Looking at json was not particular new since we used racket in the past to parse through them. However using JavaScript to parse through the json file to retrieve the information for a specific name was a new concept.</p>

<h1 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h1>

<p>While looking at the <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html">higher order functions</a> that JavaScript has we learnt one of the higher order functions is <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>. It turns out that <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> behave similar to the Racket behavior. Knowing how they were used in Racket make it a lot easier to learn how they are used in JavaScript.</p>

<h1 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h1>

<p>There were no new skills that I practiced in this lab. However I practiced my coding skills in JavaScript. I also practiced my testing skills. I achieved this by making sure the few section of code I wrote was able to pass the test cases that were defined in the lab instructions.</p>

<h1 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h1>

<p>I found the <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_TcUD2vzyMe">flattened exercise</a> to be really interesting. I found this interesting because for Assignment 3 my code was about 20 lines long. However in the lab I was able to get the same results using one line of code by using the reduce and concat method. This showed how important it is to know the higher order functions and array methods because they can make things a lot more efficient.</p>

<h1 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h1>

<p>First we had to read background information on JavaScript. This contained reading <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html">chapter 5</a> and <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html">chapter 6</a> from Eloquent JavaScript. Then we looked at array methods. In this part of the lab we focused on chapter 5 a lot. We looked at how JavaScript arrays have higher order methods. Then we worked on solving the flatten exercise using the methods <code>reduce</code> and <code>concat</code>. Then we looked at parsing through a json file using JavaScript. Here we wrote a function to find the information that is associated with a particular name that is passed in. Then we looked at methods in JavaScript.</p>

<h2>What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<p>In this lab working with 
 <b>JavaScript objects</b> was a new concept. It was interesting to see that the JavaScript objects were similar to the hash table in Racket. The next new concept was 
 <b>Deep Comparison</b>. This was a were we had to write a method to compare the values of the object's actual properties. The next new concept was 
 <b>JavaScript Arrays</b>. These were very similar to arrays that are used in Java.</p>

<h2>What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>In this lab there was not anything that was super familiar. The concept of JavaScript arrays were similar to those in Java. This helped made learning JavaScript arrays a lot easier to understand. Also having background knowledge of how arrays work too was very helpful to understand JavaScript arrays.</p>

<h2>What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>I practiced my coding skills in JavaScript. This was done by working with arrays in JavaScript and objects within JavaScript.  I also practiced my testing skills. This was done by working with jasmine in the lab to test the methods that have been created to make sure they actually worked.</p>

<h2>What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>I found how JavaScript concepts that were covered in today&rsquo;s lab was very similar to others languages we learnt in the past very interesting. It made understanding those concepts a lot easier.</p>

<h2>What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>First there were some background readings ton JavaScript and function arguments.  Then we moved on to 
 <b>JavaScript objects</b>. Here we did a quick reading on what <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html#h_cqg63Sxe3o">JavaScript</a> objects were. Then we moved to do a quick demonstrations about JavaScript objects.  Next topic covered was 
 <b>deep comparison</b>. We had to follow the deep comparison <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html#i_IJBU+aXOIC">exercise</a> from the following link.  Next topic covered was 
 <b>JavaScript arrays</b>. Here we read a section from the link on what the <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html#h_HjL/otjEJn">JavaScript arrays</a> were. Then we had some practice working with JavaScript arrays. we had to follow the steps to the sum of the range exercise to write a sum function that passes all the tests that were provided in the lab instructions. Finally we covered 
 <b>variadic functions</b>.</p>

<h2>What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<p>In this lab we continued looking JavaScript. This concepts covered in the lab was all new concept from me.</p>

<h3>JavaScript</h3>

<p>In this lab we looked at creating functions in JavaScript and using modules. This was an interesting section because it a lot of things were very similar to racket and java. Creating functions was very similar to the way they are done in java. Creating the modules were very similar to the way it was done in racket.</p>

<h3>Jasmine</h3>

<p>The next new thing we covered was jasmine. This is a unit testing tool that is used. This was a very interesting thing to cover because it is always nice to find other tools that can be used to help test the code.</p>

<h2>What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>There was nothing that was too familiar in this lab. The structure of JavaScript was familiar from racket and java. This familiar structure made it easier to gain a basic understanding of javascript.  I was also familiar with recursion from the past coding languages. Having the past knowledge made applying recursion in java script a lot easier to understand.</p>

<h2>What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>Some new skills I practiced was coding in JavaScript and testing through different tools.  The skills in JavaScript was practiced by having the whole lab be based on coding in Javascript.  The testing skills were practiced by using jasmine to run different test cases. What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important? I found the close similarities to Java and racket very interesting. It made the process of learning the new language a lot easier to begin.</p>

<h2>What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>First we looked at the 
 <b>JavaScript equality</b> and type coercion. During this we looked different statements that use <code>==</code> and looked at the results.  Then we looked at 
 <b>JavaScript functions</b>. We read <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html">JavaScript function</a> to help gain a better understanding of what they are.These are outlined very similar to the way the functions that are in Java which made it easier to understand.  After we looked at 
 <b>Node.js modules</b>. This was a very similar way of setting up modules as racket did. For this section we quickly read <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/10_modules.html">chapter 10</a> of the JavaScript book to gain a better understanding of modules in JavaScript. After we looked at Jasmine. First I read the <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/index.html">documentation</a> and the <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite">tutorial</a> to git better understanding of how the unit testing framework. Then we moved to testing to see how it worked with creating small simple unit test cases. FInally we looked at 
 <b>recursion in JavaScript</b>. This was a very similar to racket and Java.</p>

<h2>What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<p>This lab was mainly focused around JavaScript. JavaScript was a new language for me to learn today. In the lab it was really helpful to have the background knowledge of Java because it made things a lot easier to understand. It was also helpful knowing racket because there was a lot of shortcut ways of do things that you could not do in Java.   
 <h2>What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>  There was nothing that I knew from the past used that was used in this lab. However my knowledge of Java really helped to understand JavaScript a lot easier. It also helped me pick up on the JavaScript syntax.   
 <h2>What new skills did you practice?</h2> Some new skills I practiced today was using debugging in JavaScript. Another skill I practiced was coding in JavaScript. The skills I practiced today are going to become helpful throughout the course as we more more into JavaScript stuff.   
 <h2>What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2> In this lab, I found the 
 <b>VSCodium</b> really interesting. It seems like it would be very handy to debug the JavaScript in. I also found trying to solve the JavaScript problems really interesting. It was interesting to see the different ways that they could be solved.   
 <h2>What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2> In this lab we started working with JavaScript. First we started with understanding a little about JavaScript by reading a few different links posted in the lab. Then there was a demonstration on how to use VSCodium. During the demonstration we were also shown that in order to run JavaScript through the terminal, we use <code>node hello-world.js</code> . Then we used JavaScript to translate some Racket expressions. Then finally we looked at two coding problems in JavaScript.</p>
