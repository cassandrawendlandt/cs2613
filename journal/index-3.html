<p>Today in the lab we covered a fair bit of material that was new to me. The first new concept that was covered was some more different git commands. We looked at how to add just specific files, seeing what has changed after a file has been added.</p>

<p>Another new concept that was covered today was Racket. I have never worked with racket before and it was a little confusing but after I read some of the documentation things become pretty interesting. There was a new tool that was introduced to me as well. I have new used DrRacket so at first it was hard to grasp the different concepts. Another thing that was confusing to me was all the brackets that Racket likes. I got a lot of errors because I forgot brackets on statements. The tutorial was laid out nicely that explained things very well.</p>

<p>Working with DrRacket was a very interesting concept. I was really interesting working with the interactive window part. I found it very useful if you wanted to test something simple or small or see how it works. An example would be setting up the circles.</p>

<p>A familiar concept that we looked at in todays lab was git cloning and lookking at the git log. I worked with cloning in the first lab to verify that the push was successful. I also worked with git log to track the commit messages that were being made.</p>

<p>Some new skills i practiced in this lab was using git. I learned a few different commands and how to best use them so I am not committing things that dont need to be committed</p>

<p>In the lab we started with some Linux command line review. Using the command line to make directory&rsquo;s, open a plain text editor and editing files that way were familiar concepts I learned from a previous coop. It was a good review although because I have not used those commands in a while.</p>

<p>Then we moved on working with Frog. This is new concept for me to learn. It was a very interesting concept for me to learn. At first, I found it was a little confusing but after I got playing around with it and understanding the different parts within the package and the steps we had to do I found it really easy to do.</p>

<p>After we moved on to getting use to git. This was a new concept for me because I have never really worked with git besides through a web browser. First we started by reading a section from pro git. This section was very helpful for to gain a better understanding of git but reading about the basics. Understanding what the different commands do and understanding what the different messages meant was a little hard but by the end of the lab I had a lot of it understood. A new skill I had a chance to practice was working with git in a command line. I am really glad I got to practice this new skill because I think it will become very helpful in the future. I also think knowing how to be able to access git from the command line is important because it makes working with it so much easier and quicker to get the information you are looking for.</p>
