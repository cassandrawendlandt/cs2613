<h2 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<p>In this lab there were a lot of new concepts to me. One of the new topics was <strong>variable-length argument list</strong>. It was an interesting concept because some of the old ideas from previous topics were used as reference. We learnt that the function <code>varargin</code> provides similar functionality to the <code>.rest</code> argument in racket or the <code>...rest</code> function in JavaScript. This made it a bit easier to understand the main concept of the function.</p>

<p>The other new concept was the <strong>k nearest neighbour</strong> algorithm. Here we read a bit about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm">k nearest neighbour</a> to better understand it. This was a neat concept because it was different compared to the other topics we have been looking at. It was also easier to understand this concept because I could easily rely it to a real world scenario.</p>

<h2 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>In this lab there were no concepts that were familiar to me from other courses or my own knowledge. There were topics that I shouldâ€™ve known, like the linear algebra stuff since I did take a previous class on it.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>I did not learn any new skills. I did however practice my octave programming skills and my debugging skills. I practiced my octave programming skills because the whole lab was working in octave. I also improved my debugging skills because when I find out what caused my errors through the lab.</p>

<h2 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>I found this lab to be particularly difficult because there was a lot of concepts that we should know from the course <strong>linear algebra</strong>. This made it difficult because it&rsquo;s been a while since I took linear algebra. This meant in the lab I was trying to relearn linear algebra and the new material at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>First topic we looked at in the lab was cell arrays. In this section we looked at using the cell arrays as a list of vectors. Below is the few commands we used to get a better understanding on how it works.</p>

<pre><code>data = [0,0,0; 0,0,1; 0,1,0; 1,1,1]
cells = num2cell(data,2)
cellfun(@sum,cells)</code></pre>

<p>Next we moved on to look at variable-length argument list. In this section of the lab we used <a href="https://octave.org/doc/v4.2.0/Variable_002dlength-Argument-Lists.html">varargin</a> to complete the function that was given.</p>

<p>Then we looked at the <strong>K nearest neighbour</strong> section. In this section we had to fill in the function so it returns the row of indices of the k closest rows of <code>data</code> to <code>v</code>. Then we called the following lines of code from the command window to time our nearest neighbour function.</p>

<pre><code>load training
load testing
timeit(1000,@nearest,testing(1,:), 3, training);</code></pre>

<p>Then we looked at <strong>using rowfun</strong>. In this section we had to use the find function to complete a loop free version of the [K nearest neighbour] problem. Then we added the following <code>timeit</code> call to compare the time to the other k nearest neighbour solutions.</p>

<pre><code>timeit(10,@rowknn,3,training,testing);</code></pre>
