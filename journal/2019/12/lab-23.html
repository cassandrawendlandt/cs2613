<h2 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<p>In today’s lab we focused mainly on <strong>manipulating photos</strong>. Using Octave to manipulate photos was a new concept to me. We covered how to turn a photo black and white, applying gradient to a photo and added a yellow tint to them. It was a very interesting topic to explore. It was also a very confusing to follow the lab in the beginning</p>

<h2 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>There was no concepts that were familiar to be from previous courses or my own knowledge. This made the lab a bit tricky to follow along. I kept getting lost in what was being explained it was hard to catch up.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>In this lab I did not practice any new skills. I did however improve on my octave programming skills and my debugging skills. My octave programming skills were improved because the whole lab was programming in octave. One thing I have improved with this lab was working with vectors and arrays in octave. My debugging skills were improved because I came across some errors I had to solve.</p>

<h2 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>I found this lab pretty hard to follow along. I found the topics were very hard to follow and understand. It think the hardest thing for me to understand is how everything works in octave. This is the first time I ever worked with Octave and I found that I am having an extremely hard time understanding it and how it works.</p>

<h2 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>First we looked at <strong>broadcasting</strong>. We read a broadcasting section that is in the <a href="https://octave.org/doc/v4.0.3/Broadcasting.html">octave documentation</a> ** add link** to help gain a better understanding of the topic.</p>

<p>Then we moved on and looked at <strong>reshaping arrays</strong>. In this part we ran the two lines of code that is below in the command window. Then we looked at the result to get a sense of of the method <code>reshape</code> works so we can use it later in the lab.</p>

<pre><code>ones(3,3,3) .* reshape([1,2,3],[1,1,3])
ones(3,3,3) .* reshape([1,2,3],[1,3,1])</code></pre>

<p>Next we looked at <strong>scaling layers of arrays</strong>. In the section we took a black and white photo and added a yellow tint to it. We had to fill in the function <code>scale_layers</code>. Below is what the function would look like.</p>

<pre><code>function out = scale_layers(array, weights)
  out = array .* reshape(weights,[1,1,3]);
endfunction</code></pre>

<p>After we looked at <strong>converting to monochrome</strong>. In this section we took a photo of an owl and applied the following method to it. Below is the function we had to fill in to have the photo transferred into monochrome.</p>

<pre><code>function out = monochrome(in, weights=[0.21,0.72,0.07])
  out = sum(scale_layers(in,weights), 3);
endfunction</code></pre>

<p>The last thing we looked at was <strong>changing the gradient</strong> or the amount of intensity of a photo. We ran some sample code quickly to get an understanding how the function <code>gradient</code> works. Then we filled in the following function to display the owl picture using the <code>norming</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>function normimg = normgrad(img)
  [Dx, Dy] = gradient(img);
  normimg = sqrt(Dx.^2 + Dy.^2);
endfunction</code></pre>
