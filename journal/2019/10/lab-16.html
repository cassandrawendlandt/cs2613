<h2 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<h3 id="map">Map</h3>

<p>Today we talked what <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map">map</a> does in python. It acts similar to the map we saw in racket which made it easier to understand. It was a little confusing to understand at the beginning but the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_map.asp">following link</a> really helped to understand it a lot more.</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>

<p>The other new concept we covered today in the lab was <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format">format strings</a>. This concept seemed a lot similar to the format in c. This was helpful to gain a better understanding of what was going on.</p>

<h2 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>Most of this lab was familiar to me because I have already worked with it in a previous class. I also worked with a lot of the topics in the lab for the assignment as well. This was helpful because I picked up on some tips I can use in the assignment to improve my code.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>During the lab I did not practice any new skills but I did improve on skills that I already have. The first skill I improved on was my python coding skills. This skill was improved because the whole lab was programming in python. The next skill I improved on was my problem solving skills. I improved this skill because a good chunk of the lab was working by yourself.</p>

<h2 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>I found that the lab was pretty easy overall. There were some spots that I found hard to get like the map question. The rest I had a pretty good understanding before the lab so it made it easy to follow along and gain more from the lab as well.</p>

<h2 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>During this lab we started by looking at <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/comprehensions.html#listcomprehension">list comprehensions</a>. First we had to fill in the blank of the missing code.Then we moved onto <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/comprehensions.html#dictionarycomprehension">dictionary comprehensions</a> . This section was fairly familiar with since I used in the assignment already. In this part of the lab we had to turn a list into a dictionary. The line of code I used to complete this was <code>{i+1: lst[i] for i in range ( 0 , len (lst))}</code> but then after having a discussion I found a more concise way of writing the same line. The better way to write this is <code>{i+1: lst[i] for i in range ( len (lst))}</code>.</p>
