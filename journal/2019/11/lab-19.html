<h2 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<p>In today&rsquo;s lab there was a lot of topics I was familiar with from previous courses. However, there were a few topics that were new to me. The topics that were new to me was <code>__inter__</code> and <code>__next__</code>. At the beginning they were difficult to understand but after reading <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/iterators.html">DiP3 Chapter 7</a> helped me to understand them better.</p>

<h2 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>A lot of the topics in today’s lab was very familiar to me from a previous course I took. There were a few things that were not familiar when I first started working on them. As I worked through the lab and some of the documentation then everything started to come back to me. I found that having a little bit of previous knowledge made the lab easier to follow. It also allowed me to fully understand everything that was discussed in the lab.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>In this lab I did not gain any new skills. However, I did improve on a couple skills I already have. The first skill I improved was my python programming skills. I accomplished this because having the whole lab in python. I also improved writing classes in python. I improved writing classes by learning how the <code>__inter__</code> and <code>__next__</code> methods work. This will help me later on when I am writing my own classes in the future.</p>

<h2 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>During this lab I found understanding how the <code>__next__</code> method a bit difficult in the beginning. Once I got an understanding how it works, then the rest of the lab was easier to complete because I was familiar with most of the topics from a previous course.</p>

<h2 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>We started the lab with looking at <strong>Counters, generators and classes</strong>. We looked at the counter code from Lab 18 and generated the numbers by providing a compatible interface by using a <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/iterators.html#defining-classes">python class</a>.  Then we looked at the Fibonacci series and completed the definition of <code>__next__</code> so it will act like the generator.</p>

<div class="brush: python">
 <pre><code>def __next__(self):
	if self.max &gt; self.a: 
		self.a,self.b = self.b,self.a + self.b
		return self.b-self.a
	else: 
		raise StopIteration</code></pre></div>

<p>The code above shows what the <code>__next__</code> function would look like. I found it was basically just taking the closure code from the last lab which made it easy to grasp the concept of how it was done.  Then we looked <strong>object copying and equality</strong>. During this part of the lab we had to write the code for the method<a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/special-method-names.html#rich-comparisons"> <code>__eq__</code></a>inorder for the test to pass. Then we also wrote an <code>eqal</code> method to be able to do arithmetic.  Then in the lab we used <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html">deepCopy</a> to update one of our test sets to make sure the ‘eqal` method does not change the object self.</p>
