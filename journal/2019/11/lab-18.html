<h2 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<p>In today’s lab we covered <strong>closures</strong>. We used closures to mimic generator code which I found a bit interesting. This topic was completely new to me. I found that after I read <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/generators.html">chapter 6 from DiP3</a> the topics seemed a bit easier to follow. At the beginning, the topic was a bit difficult to understand. Then I found that after working on examples it became much easier to understand.</p>

<h2 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>In this lab there wasn&rsquo;t any concepts that were familiar to me. This made it a little hard to follow along at the beginning of the lab but once I started to understand the material it was much easier to follow along and understand what was happening.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>I did not practice any new skills in this lab. However I did improve on my python programming skills as well as my debugging skills. I improved on my debugging skills because I made a lot of errors so I had to go through and find where the errors were. Then I had to use my previous knowledge to figure out how to fix it, I improved my python programming skills because the whole lab was coding in python.</p>

<h2 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>In the beginning I found the concept of the was a little tricky to understand. Once we finished going over the first example, it made more sense and the rest of the questions seem to be a bit easier. This helped me to really grasp the topic because I was able to understand the basic concepts when we the class discussed it more.</p>

<h2 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>The whole lab was just looking at how <strong>closures</strong> work to simulate generators and then a few examples. The first example we looked at was <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/generators.html#generators">Counter</a>. For this example we were given the code that uses the generator. Then we had to write a function that mimics the behaviour of the other one. Below is an example of the function that we had to write.</p>

<div class="brush: python">
 <pre><code>def make_counter2(x):
	count = x
	def counter():
		nonlocal count,x
		if count ==x:
			print ('Entering make_counter')
		x = x+1
		return x-1
	return counter</code></pre></div>

<p>The next example we looked at is the <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/generators.html#a-fibonacci-generator">Fibonacci series</a>. Here we had to fill in the function <code>fib2</code> that will mimic the function <code>fib</code>. Below is an example of the definition for <code>fib2</code>.</p>

<div class="brush: python">
 <pre><code>def fib2(max):
    a,b = 0,1
    def next():
        nonlocal a,b
        if a &lt; max:
            a , b = b, a+b
            return b-a
        else:
            return None
    return next</code></pre></div>
