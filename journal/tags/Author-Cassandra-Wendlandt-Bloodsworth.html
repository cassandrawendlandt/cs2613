<h2 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<h3 id="working-with-grids">Working with grids</h3>

<p>During this section of the lab we observed how ranges work and how <code>surf</code> work. The function <code>surf</code> takes in points and plots them in a graph. We also saw how the <a href="https://octave.org/doc/v4.2.1/Three_002dDimensional-Plots.html#XREFmeshgrid">meshgrid</a> function that Octave had built in works. Meshgrid will take a cartesian product of two arrays.</p>

<h3 id="creating-3d-plots">Creating 3d plots</h3>

<p>The next new topic we looked at was making 3D plots. In the past labs we used <code>surf()</code> which created a 3D plot but we never looked much into writing the code to initialize the points. This was a pretty interesting section because the plot that was produced was very interesting. We also discovered that there is something called <code>contourf()</code>. This will produce a 2D version of the plot.  Using arrayfun</p>

<p>In this section we learnt what <code>arrayfun</code> is and how to use <a href="https://octave.org/doc/v4.2.0/Anonymous-Functions.html">anonymous functions</a>.</p>

<h4 id="arrayfun">arrayfun</h4>

<p>The function <code>arrayfun</code> will take a function as the first parameter then the other functions will be arrays. This function will take one or more arrays in. Then <code>arrayfun</code> will apply the given function to each of the element in the arrays.</p>

<h4 id="anonymous-function">anonymous function</h4>

<p>Anonymous functions in the Octave can appear in two different formats. Below is the first format. It takes the function and assigns it to a variable. Then pass the variable where the function would go.  Below is the second format that an anonymous function can appear. Here the function is directly written in.</p>

<h2 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>In the lab there was only one concepts that I was familiar with. This made the lab a little tricky to do. At the beginning I was confused on what was going. When we got about half way through the lab it started to make sense. This made the last half of the lab a bit easier to follow.</p>

<p>The concept I was familiar with was defining and testing a function. I was only a little familiar with this topic because we looked at in the last lab. This did not really help me to understand the lab because I still did not understand them completely. At the end of today&rsquo;s lab I understand them a bit better.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>During the lab I worked on my Octave programming skills. I did this because the whole lab was programming in Octave. I also worked on my debugging skills. This skill was improved because throughout the lab I got a couple errors and I had to figure out how to fix them. The most frequent error I got was that I was not calling the files with the test cases in them properly. Instead of calling them by <code>test delta</code>, I was just calling <code>delta</code>.</p>

<h2 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>I found how to create a range interesting. This seemed similar to some of the languages we looked at. The code to create a range is <code>r = [-1:0.5:1]</code>. The first parameter (&ndash;1) is the starting point in the range. The second parameter (0.5) is how much to increment by. The third parameter (1) is the end number.</p>

<h2 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>First we looked at girds and how you can create them in Octave. We also explore how Octave creates ranges.</p>

<p>Then we moved to defining and testing functions. During this section of the lab we filled in the function that was provided in the lab instructions. We then had to complete the three test cases that was also provided.</p>

<p>Then we moved to creating 3D plots. We had to fill in the code for the file <code>surfvex</code> that was provided in the lab instructions. Below is an example of what the code would look like for <code>surfvex</code>.</p>

<pre><code>a = [4;4];
beta = 7.5;

%% Generating vectors
range = [-4:0.1:8];

% Compute cartesian product (grid)
[X,Y] = meshgrid(range,range);
[rows,cols] = size(X);

for i = 1:rows
  for j = 1:cols
    b = [X(i,j); Y(i,j)];
    Z(i,j) = delta (beta,a,b);
  endfor
endfor

surf(X,Y,Z);
%contourf(X,Y,Z);</code></pre>

<p>During this section we replaced <code>surf(X,Y,Z)</code> with <code>contour(X,Y,Z)</code>.</p>

<p>Then we moved on to look at arrayfun and anonymous functions. The previous graphs were created in the file <code>surfvex</code>. For this section we had to create a file called <code>surfvex2</code>. This will produce the same graphs as above by using anonymous functions instead of the for loop. We had to fill in <code>f</code> so it becomes an anonymous function. Below is what the code looks like with the anonymous function.</p>

<p>We compared the time it took the anonymous function to run compared to the one with the for loop. It turns out that the function that uses the anonymous function is a bit faster. Below is a copy of what was typed into the command line.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; surfvex
Elapsed time is 0.672515 seconds.
&gt;&gt; surfvex2
Elapsed time is 0.548361 seconds.</code></pre>

<h2 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<h3 id="octave">Octave</h3>

<p>In the lab most of the material was a new concept to me. I never worked with matlab or octave so it was an interesting experience.</p>

<p>A big lesson I learnt in the lab was the need for semicolons. I found out that if you do not have a semicolon at the end of setting a variable, octave will print out the variable. This caused my function <code>fib()</code> to print out the variables every time it went through the for loop.</p>

<p>We used the Fibonacci series, matrices and vectors as examples to get to know Octave and how it works. I found that Octave is a language that is good for working with numbers and graphs.</p>

<h3 id="performance-comparison-and-measuring-cpu-time">Performance comparison and measuring CPU time</h3>

<p>Comparing performance between the two different functions in octave was an interesting topic. I thought the function <code>tic()</code>and <code>toc()</code> were really interesting. The function <code>tic()</code> started counting the time and <code>toc()</code> will stop the counting.</p>

<p>When we measured the CPU time we did not use <code>tic()</code> and <code>toc()</code>. However, we did use octaves built in <code>cputime</code>.</p>

<p>We found that the first function <code>fib()</code> that only used the for loop was a lot slower than the second function <code>fibmat()</code>.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-profiler">Using the profiler</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://octave.org/doc/v4.0.3/Profiling.html">profiling tool</a> was interesting to work with. The tool would tell you where your code spends most of the time. To run the it you would first type <code>profile on</code> in the command line. Then you would type the function that you want to evaluate. So an example from class would be <code>fib(1000)</code>. Once the function is done you would type <code>profile off</code>. In order to get the results from the you would have to type <code>profshow</code>. It will produce a table like the below showing the hot spot for that function.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; profshow
   #            Function Attr     Time (s)   Time (%)        Calls
------------------------------------------------------------------
   1                 fib             0.012      90.50            1
   2            binary +             0.001       6.12         1001
   5             profile             0.000       1.26            1
   4                disp             0.000       1.00            1
   3             display             0.000       0.89            1
   6              nargin             0.000       0.08            1
   8               false             0.000       0.07            1
   7           binary !=             0.000       0.06            1
   9 __profiler_enable__             0.000       0.00            1
</code></pre>

<p>An important thing is that you have to clear the profile each time before you use it.</p>

<h2 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>In the lab there was no concepts that were familiar from my own knowledge. The only thing that I was familiar with was the Fibonacci series. Knowing the Fibonacci series helped me understand how Octave works better. I was able to understand the syntax a lot better since I knew how the problem works.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>The new skills I worked on was programming in Octave. I improved this skill because the whole lab was working in Octave. The other skills I worked on was debugging in Octave. I did this because I had a few times where the code was not working or was not printing the same output as others. Then I need to figure out why.</p>

<h2 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>During the lab I found working with Octave to be confusing to work with in the beginning. I found it to be difficult because it has been a while since I worked with matrices and vectors. It was difficult because I was trying to remember how matrices and vectors work as well as learning how the new language worked as well.</p>

<h2 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>First we ran added code to the for loop so the Fibonacci series would work. Then we ran test cases to make sure it produces the correct answers. In octave the test cases are written in the code as comments.</p>

<p>Then in order to run the test cases you type <code>test fib(1000)</code> in the command line in Octave. Then we looked at the Fibonacci series as matrix multiplication. We used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Matrix_form">well known</a> identity about the Fibonacci numbers F(i) to help use write the code.</p>

<p>Then we did a performance comparison between the two functions. We created a function called <code>timeit</code> and <code>bench</code> to measure the how long it takes the function. The following is a example of how we called the <code>bench</code> function and the output. We can see that the second function <code>fibmat</code> takes a lot less time than the first method <code>fib</code>.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; bench
fib     median=0.117ms mean=0.120ms total=11960.450ms
fibmat  median=0.024ms mean=0.024ms total=2414.605ms</code></pre>

<p>Then we compared the CPU time for each function as well. We created a function called <code>ctimeit</code> and <code>cbench</code> to measure the CPU time. The following is a example of how we called the <code>cbench</code> function and the output. We can see that the second function <code>fibmat</code> takes a lot less CPU time than the first method <code>fib</code>.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; cbench
fib     median=0.119ms mean=0.125ms total=12512.951ms
fibmat  median=0.026ms mean=0.028ms total=2771.087ms</code></pre>

<p>The last thing we looked at was how to use the <a href="https://octave.org/doc/v4.0.3/Profiling.html">profiling tool</a>. We used the profiler to look where the functions hotspots are. When we compared the time it took the functions we looked at the overall time. The profile tool allowed us to see how much time each call took.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<p>In today&rsquo;s lab there was a lot of topics I was familiar with from previous courses. However, there were a few topics that were new to me. The topics that were new to me was <code>__inter__</code> and <code>__next__</code>. At the beginning they were difficult to understand but after reading <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/iterators.html">DiP3 Chapter 7</a> helped me to understand them better.</p>

<h2 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>A lot of the topics in today’s lab was very familiar to me from a previous course I took. There were a few things that were not familiar when I first started working on them. As I worked through the lab and some of the documentation then everything started to come back to me. I found that having a little bit of previous knowledge made the lab easier to follow. It also allowed me to fully understand everything that was discussed in the lab.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>In this lab I did not gain any new skills. However, I did improve on a couple skills I already have. The first skill I improved was my python programming skills. I accomplished this because having the whole lab in python. I also improved writing classes in python. I improved writing classes by learning how the <code>__inter__</code> and <code>__next__</code> methods work. This will help me later on when I am writing my own classes in the future.</p>

<h2 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>During this lab I found understanding how the <code>__next__</code> method a bit difficult in the beginning. Once I got an understanding how it works, then the rest of the lab was easier to complete because I was familiar with most of the topics from a previous course.</p>

<h2 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>We started the lab with looking at <strong>Counters, generators and classes</strong>. We looked at the counter code from Lab 18 and generated the numbers by providing a compatible interface by using a <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/iterators.html#defining-classes">python class</a>.  Then we looked at the Fibonacci series and completed the definition of <code>__next__</code> so it will act like the generator.</p>

<div class="brush: python">
 <pre><code>def __next__(self):
	if self.max &gt; self.a: 
		self.a,self.b = self.b,self.a + self.b
		return self.b-self.a
	else: 
		raise StopIteration</code></pre></div>

<p>The code above shows what the <code>__next__</code> function would look like. I found it was basically just taking the closure code from the last lab which made it easy to grasp the concept of how it was done.  Then we looked <strong>object copying and equality</strong>. During this part of the lab we had to write the code for the method<a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/special-method-names.html#rich-comparisons"> <code>__eq__</code></a>inorder for the test to pass. Then we also wrote an <code>eqal</code> method to be able to do arithmetic.  Then in the lab we used <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html">deepCopy</a> to update one of our test sets to make sure the ‘eqal` method does not change the object self.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<p>In today’s lab we covered <strong>closures</strong>. We used closures to mimic generator code which I found a bit interesting. This topic was completely new to me. I found that after I read <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/generators.html">chapter 6 from DiP3</a> the topics seemed a bit easier to follow. At the beginning, the topic was a bit difficult to understand. Then I found that after working on examples it became much easier to understand.</p>

<h2 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>In this lab there wasn&rsquo;t any concepts that were familiar to me. This made it a little hard to follow along at the beginning of the lab but once I started to understand the material it was much easier to follow along and understand what was happening.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>I did not practice any new skills in this lab. However I did improve on my python programming skills as well as my debugging skills. I improved on my debugging skills because I made a lot of errors so I had to go through and find where the errors were. Then I had to use my previous knowledge to figure out how to fix it, I improved my python programming skills because the whole lab was coding in python.</p>

<h2 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>In the beginning I found the concept of the was a little tricky to understand. Once we finished going over the first example, it made more sense and the rest of the questions seem to be a bit easier. This helped me to really grasp the topic because I was able to understand the basic concepts when we the class discussed it more.</p>

<h2 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>The whole lab was just looking at how <strong>closures</strong> work to simulate generators and then a few examples. The first example we looked at was <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/generators.html#generators">Counter</a>. For this example we were given the code that uses the generator. Then we had to write a function that mimics the behaviour of the other one. Below is an example of the function that we had to write.</p>

<div class="brush: python">
 <pre><code>def make_counter2(x):
	count = x
	def counter():
		nonlocal count,x
		if count ==x:
			print ('Entering make_counter')
		x = x+1
		return x-1
	return counter</code></pre></div>

<p>The next example we looked at is the <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/generators.html#a-fibonacci-generator">Fibonacci series</a>. Here we had to fill in the function <code>fib2</code> that will mimic the function <code>fib</code>. Below is an example of the definition for <code>fib2</code>.</p>

<div class="brush: python">
 <pre><code>def fib2(max):
    a,b = 0,1
    def next():
        nonlocal a,b
        if a &lt; max:
            a , b = b, a+b
            return b-a
        else:
            return None
    return next</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="regular-expression">Regular Expression</h3>

<p>During this section of the lab we looked at how regular expressions worked. We followed the <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/regular-expressions.html#streetaddresses">example</a> for the textbook. This example helped make regular expression much easier to understand. In the demo we ran <code>re.sub('Road$','RD.',s)</code>. This little section of the code looks in the string s, and tries to find &lsquo;Road&rsquo;. The dollar signs make it so that &lsquo;Road&rsquo; has to be at the end of the string. Once &lsquo;Road&rsquo; is found then it will replace it with &lsquo;RD.&rsquo;. The quick demo made it much easier to understand regular expression. Another thing that really helped to understand the regular expressions was reading <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/regular-expressions.html">chapter5</a> of the book <strong>Dive Into Python 3</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="stripping-quotes">Stripping Quotes</h3>

<p>This section of the lab builds off the previous section.This section we used regular expressions to remove all the <strong>""</strong> that may be in a string. During this part there was a lot of new concepts introduced like the <code>[^"]</code> is a character class. This section of the lab was a bit difficult to understand at the beginning. Once the topics were explained a bit more in details it was a little easier to understand. The</p>

<h3 id="handling-quoted-commas">Handling Quoted Commas</h3>

<p>During this section of the lab we worked on creating a function that will break things up into three different columns. This section of the lab was pretty tricky to understand at the beginning. A document that really helped me understand the topic a lot more was from the textbook <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/regular-expressions.html#verbosere">Dive Into Python 3</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>One of the familiar topics in today&rsquo;s lab was splitting strings. This was familiar for a course I took last year. At the beginning I had a hard to remembering how <code>split</code> and <code>splitlines</code> work. After looking at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp">split</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_splitlines.asp">splitlines</a> I was able to complete the section of the lab without any problem.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>Some of the new skills I practiced during the lab was using regular expressions. I also improved on my python coding skills because the whole lab was programming in python. During the lab I also improved on my debugging skills and problem solving skills. This was improved by having to examine the different errors my code was throwing and trying to figure out how to fix them.</p>

<h2 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>During the lab one of the easiest topics cover was <strong>splitting strings</strong>. This was easier because I already had some experience working with them. The topics on <strong>regular expressions</strong> were a bit more tricky to follow and understand at the beginning.</p>

<h2 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>In the lab we first worked with <strong>splitting strings</strong>. In this section of the lab we had to separate strings when a comma appears. Then we moved on to working with <strong>regular expressions</strong>. In this section we looked at an <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/regular-expressions.html#streetaddresses">example</a> from <strong>Dive Into Python 3</strong>. We went through this example as group and discussed each of the lines a bit. Then we looked at <strong>stripping quotes</strong>. In this section we took what we talked about regular expression and put it into practice. Some of the documents we read in this section was on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects">groups</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax">regular expression syntax</a>from the python documentation. Then we looked at <strong>handling quoted comma</strong>. In this section we completed the definition of <code>split_row_3</code> that was given in the lab. The code was suppose to add the strings into 3 different columns then remove the commas. During this section we read the document on <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/regular-expressions.html#verbosere">verbose reqular expressions</a> from <strong>Dive Into Python 3</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<h3 id="map">Map</h3>

<p>Today we talked what <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map">map</a> does in python. It acts similar to the map we saw in racket which made it easier to understand. It was a little confusing to understand at the beginning but the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_map.asp">following link</a> really helped to understand it a lot more.</p>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>

<p>The other new concept we covered today in the lab was <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format">format strings</a>. This concept seemed a lot similar to the format in c. This was helpful to gain a better understanding of what was going on.</p>

<h2 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>Most of this lab was familiar to me because I have already worked with it in a previous class. I also worked with a lot of the topics in the lab for the assignment as well. This was helpful because I picked up on some tips I can use in the assignment to improve my code.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>During the lab I did not practice any new skills but I did improve on skills that I already have. The first skill I improved on was my python coding skills. This skill was improved because the whole lab was programming in python. The next skill I improved on was my problem solving skills. I improved this skill because a good chunk of the lab was working by yourself.</p>

<h2 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>I found that the lab was pretty easy overall. There were some spots that I found hard to get like the map question. The rest I had a pretty good understanding before the lab so it made it easy to follow along and gain more from the lab as well.</p>

<h2 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>During this lab we started by looking at <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/comprehensions.html#listcomprehension">list comprehensions</a>. First we had to fill in the blank of the missing code.Then we moved onto <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/comprehensions.html#dictionarycomprehension">dictionary comprehensions</a> . This section was fairly familiar with since I used in the assignment already. In this part of the lab we had to turn a list into a dictionary. The line of code I used to complete this was <code>{i+1: lst[i] for i in range ( 0 , len (lst))}</code> but then after having a discussion I found a more concise way of writing the same line. The better way to write this is <code>{i+1: lst[i] for i in range ( len (lst))}</code>.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<h3 id="global-variables-from-files">Global variables from files</h3>

<p>In this lab I learnt that you could use a global variable from the file for the test cases or in other files. To import a global variable the line of code we used was <code>from filename import variable</code>. This would make testing easier when it is hard to return variables that depends on what was called in the past.</p>

<h3 id="pytest-commands">Pytest commands</h3>

<p>In this lab we learnt some new commands that will show the coverage of the python program. The first new one we looked at was <code>pytest-3 --cov = rpn</code>. This command will produce a summary of the statements in the file rpn. It will provide the number of statements that were missed if there is any. It will also tell you the percentage of coverage for the file. The other pytest command we looked at was <code>pytest-3 --cov=rpn --cov-report=term-missing</code>. This command will display all the same information as the previous one but it also list any lines that were missed.</p>

<h2 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>The most familiar concept for this lab was programming in python. The overall base of the lab was really easy to follow along with since I already had a base knowledge in python from a previous course.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>There was not any new skills that I really practiced. However, I did improve on my testing skills. This was done by learning the pytest commands. Knowing these commands will help ensure that I can get full coverage.</p>

<h2 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>In today’s lab I found the new commands for pytest to be the most interesting. I think the pytest commands were the most interesting because it will be very helpful later on when checking for full test coverage. I also found the lab easy to follow along which was really nice because it allowed me to be able to focus more on what was being said.</p>

<h2 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>First we looked at the <strong>reverse polish notation calculator</strong> problem described in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">wikipedia</a>. Then we started programming it. First we got the stack set up to store the numbers. Then we looked at the different pytest commands that may become helpful in test. Then we moved on to adding <code>if elif else</code> to the function to test if any arithmetic needs to be done. Once that was done we looked at improving the robustness of the tests. In this section of the lab we added and <code>elif</code> to the method to handle when <code>"clear”</code> is passed through. When clear is passed through it will empty the stack of numbers. Then we added <code>elif</code> to check for <code>"dup” “pop” “swap”</code>. Once we got those methods implemented we added an <code>elif</code> to check to see if <code>”print”</code> is passed through then prints the last element in the stack. Then we worked added a method to handle if a string of operations is passed through to go through and complete them in order.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<p>One new concepts I learnt this lab was testing in python. Today I learnt about the tool called <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a> that is used to test the code. This is a similar concept to the testing tool we used in JavaScript called <code>jasmine</code>. This was nice because it made it easier to understand pytest in the beginning.</p>

<h2 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>The concept that was familiar to me was coding in Python since I already took a course on it. This made it easy to follow along in the lab and understand what was happening.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>In this lab I did not practice any new skills. However I practice so existing skills. One skill that I improved on was my testing skills. In the lab I learnt how pytest worked to be able to use it to test the code created. I improved my python programming skills as well since the lab was an introduction to coding in python.</p>

<h2 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>An interesting topic in today&rsquo;s lab was the <strong>pytest</strong>. This was an interesting topic because I never knew about it. This functions appears to make testing python files a lot easier than when I had to do it in other courses.</p>

<h2 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>We were given <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/books/diveintopython3/your-first-python-program.html#everythingisanobject">chapter 1</a> in <strong>Dive into Python 3</strong> to read for the lab. This reading was very helpful in the lab to explain topics I was having problems with.  First we copied the python code from <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/labs/L14/_humansize.py/">humansize.py</a> and ran it from the command line using <code>python3 humansize.py</code>. Then we ran them through the terminal using <code>python3</code> and typed in lines to run the function.  Then we moved to writing test cases using <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a>. We first copied the <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/labs/L14/_test_humansize.py/">initial test cases</a>that were given during the lab. We ran the test cases in the terminal by using <code>pytest-3</code>. Then we ran it through vscodium but adding the <code>Python: Configure Tests</code> in the terminal then we were able to run the test cases.  After we moved onto looking at modules in python. Here we saw that if we want a function from a file we can add <code>from humansize import approximate size</code>. Then if we want to be able to access all the functions in a file we add <code>import humansize</code>.  The last two topics we looked at was <strong>indentation</strong> and <strong>expectations</strong> in python. For the indentation section we looked at the FizzBuzz problem and added the indentations so the code will run properly. After that we looked at expectations. In this section we had to fix the function to make it check so it does not divide by 0.</p>

<h1 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h1>

<p>During this lab we looked at <strong>timers</strong> and <strong>animations</strong>. These were fairly new topics to me as I have not seen them much. It was really neat to see how the animation ran while using the robot example from <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/labs/L12/">lab 12</a>. Setting the time interval was a brand new concept to me. Using the <code>timer = setInterval (frame, 300)</code> seemed a lot easier to understand than the <code>setTimeout(function () {loop (i-1, str+”*”): }, 1000);</code> to understand. It seemed easier to understand because you can easily place what is what by looking at it right away. They only bad thing about it, is that you need to remember to have a <code>clearInterval</code> so it does not run forever.</p>

<h1 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h1>

<p>There was not any concepts that I was familiar with from other courses or my own knowledge this time around.</p>

<h1 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h1>

<p>The new skills that I practiced was my debugging skills, JavaScript programming skills, and problem solving skills. I practiced my debugging skills by having to work through the errors that was given and try to fix them. There were a few problems that I could not get so I asked my classmates and they helped solve them and showed me new debugging techniques. By working with through my problems and getting my classmates help I practiced my problem solving skills. I improved my JavaScript coding skills since the whole lab was completed in JavaScript.</p>

<h1 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h1>

<p>I found the animation part of the lab to be very interesting. It was cool to see a visual representation of the robot moving around the screen. I found this interesting because I find anything that is interactive or just constantly active for a set time to be very interesting.</p>

<h1 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h1>

<p>First we looked at <strong>timers</strong>. We had to run the provided code. While doing this we noticed that it was not 100 % correct since all done was being printed before the animation is actually complete. We then had to make changes to the code in order for it to work properly. The changes we made was putting the print statement into an else statement with the timer.  Then we implemented another timer. This one did not use recursion like the previous one.  After that the lab was just about setting up the <strong>animation</strong> for the robot exercise that is in <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/07_robot.html">chapter 7</a> of Eloquent JavaScript and from last lab as well.</p>

<h1 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h1>

<h2 id="array-methods">Array methods</h2>

<p>Looking at Array methods we learnt that they have higher order functions that can be really useful. Learning these functions ended up being useful for working with larger lists. For example using <code>reduced</code> and an anonymous function to calculate the average of a list. Another array method that was new for me was <code>forEach</code>. This method gives the users to iterate over a list with an arbitrary action without fussing with loops indices and bounds.</p>

<h2 id="json-parsing">Json parsing</h2>

<p>Looking at json was not particular new since we used racket in the past to parse through them. However using JavaScript to parse through the json file to retrieve the information for a specific name was a new concept.</p>

<h1 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h1>

<p>While looking at the <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html">higher order functions</a> that JavaScript has we learnt one of the higher order functions is <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>. It turns out that <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> behave similar to the Racket behavior. Knowing how they were used in Racket make it a lot easier to learn how they are used in JavaScript.</p>

<h1 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h1>

<p>There were no new skills that I practiced in this lab. However I practiced my coding skills in JavaScript. I also practiced my testing skills. I achieved this by making sure the few section of code I wrote was able to pass the test cases that were defined in the lab instructions.</p>

<h1 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h1>

<p>I found the <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_TcUD2vzyMe">flattened exercise</a> to be really interesting. I found this interesting because for Assignment 3 my code was about 20 lines long. However in the lab I was able to get the same results using one line of code by using the reduce and concat method. This showed how important it is to know the higher order functions and array methods because they can make things a lot more efficient.</p>

<h1 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h1>

<p>First we had to read background information on JavaScript. This contained reading <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html">chapter 5</a> and <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html">chapter 6</a> from Eloquent JavaScript. Then we looked at array methods. In this part of the lab we focused on chapter 5 a lot. We looked at how JavaScript arrays have higher order methods. Then we worked on solving the flatten exercise using the methods <code>reduce</code> and <code>concat</code>. Then we looked at parsing through a json file using JavaScript. Here we wrote a function to find the information that is associated with a particular name that is passed in. Then we looked at methods in JavaScript.</p>
