<h1 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h1>

<p>During this lab we looked at <strong>timers</strong> and <strong>animations</strong>. These were fairly new topics to me as I have not seen them much. It was really neat to see how the animation ran while using the robot example from <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/labs/L12/">lab 12</a>. Setting the time interval was a brand new concept to me. Using the <code>timer = setInterval (frame, 300)</code> seemed a lot easier to understand than the <code>setTimeout(function () {loop (i-1, str+”*”): }, 1000);</code> to understand. It seemed easier to understand because you can easily place what is what by looking at it right away. They only bad thing about it, is that you need to remember to have a <code>clearInterval</code> so it does not run forever.</p>

<h1 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h1>

<p>There was not any concepts that I was familiar with from other courses or my own knowledge this time around.</p>

<h1 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h1>

<p>The new skills that I practiced was my debugging skills, JavaScript programming skills, and problem solving skills. I practiced my debugging skills by having to work through the errors that was given and try to fix them. There were a few problems that I could not get so I asked my classmates and they helped solve them and showed me new debugging techniques. By working with through my problems and getting my classmates help I practiced my problem solving skills. I improved my JavaScript coding skills since the whole lab was completed in JavaScript.</p>

<h1 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h1>

<p>I found the animation part of the lab to be very interesting. It was cool to see a visual representation of the robot moving around the screen. I found this interesting because I find anything that is interactive or just constantly active for a set time to be very interesting.</p>

<h1 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h1>

<p>First we looked at <strong>timers</strong>. We had to run the provided code. While doing this we noticed that it was not 100 % correct since all done was being printed before the animation is actually complete. We then had to make changes to the code in order for it to work properly. The changes we made was putting the print statement into an else statement with the timer.  Then we implemented another timer. This one did not use recursion like the previous one.  After that the lab was just about setting up the <strong>animation</strong> for the robot exercise that is in <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/07_robot.html">chapter 7</a> of Eloquent JavaScript and from last lab as well.</p>

<h1 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h1>

<p>This lab was mainly about completing the project The Robot from <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/07_robot.html">Chapter 7</a> of the Eloquent JavaScript. We were introduced to <strong>Spy</strong> to use it as as tool to intercept calls to <code>console.log</code> . Spy is to be used when methods are terrible to test because they do not return anything. This allows you to be able to test the source code without actually changing the source code. Spys essentially replaces <code>console.log</code>. Another new concept was <code>class</code> in JavaScript. They seem to work very similar was the classes in java which made it easier to understand what is going on.</p>

<h1 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h1>

<p>There was not a lot of concepts that were familiar from other course or from my own knowledge.</p>

<h1 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h1>

<p>I did not practice any new skills. However I did practice writing test cases in jasmine. I did this by having to write the test cases for each method that was added to ensure it worked.</p>

<h1 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h1>

<p>I found the ideas about spy’s to be pretty interesting. I found them to be interesting because it was a different way to test functions that did not return anything. They seem like they would be useful in testing things later on.</p>

<h1 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h1>

<p>First we started with representing a graph. This was done by going to <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/07_robot.html#h_UmFK5fYed8">Meadowfield</a> and copying the code. Then we created jasmine test cases to test the code that we copied. Then we copy the <code>VillageState</code> class from <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/07_robot.html#h_oekYfM5x02">Eloquent JavaScript</a>. Next we created jasmine test cases for the class. In order to do this we took the suggested output from chapter 7 and converted it into jasmine test cases. We had to add some extra cases in order to get full test coverage. Next we moved on to work with Spy’s. We read the <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite#section-Spies:_%3Ccode%3EcreateSpy%3C/code%3E">documentation</a> on it quickly. We used spy’s to test the random robot section of the code.</p>

<h1 id="what-new-concepts-if-any-did-you-learn-about-in-this-lab">What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h1>

<h2 id="array-methods">Array methods</h2>

<p>Looking at Array methods we learnt that they have higher order functions that can be really useful. Learning these functions ended up being useful for working with larger lists. For example using <code>reduced</code> and an anonymous function to calculate the average of a list. Another array method that was new for me was <code>forEach</code>. This method gives the users to iterate over a list with an arbitrary action without fussing with loops indices and bounds.</p>

<h2 id="json-parsing">Json parsing</h2>

<p>Looking at json was not particular new since we used racket in the past to parse through them. However using JavaScript to parse through the json file to retrieve the information for a specific name was a new concept.</p>

<h1 id="what-concepts-are-familiar-from-other-courses-or-from-your-own-knowledge">What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h1>

<p>While looking at the <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html">higher order functions</a> that JavaScript has we learnt one of the higher order functions is <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>. It turns out that <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> behave similar to the Racket behavior. Knowing how they were used in Racket make it a lot easier to learn how they are used in JavaScript.</p>

<h1 id="what-new-skills-did-you-practice">What new skills did you practice?</h1>

<p>There were no new skills that I practiced in this lab. However I practiced my coding skills in JavaScript. I also practiced my testing skills. I achieved this by making sure the few section of code I wrote was able to pass the test cases that were defined in the lab instructions.</p>

<h1 id="what-specific-details-did-you-find-surprising-interesting-confusing-difficult-or-otherwise-important">What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h1>

<p>I found the <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_TcUD2vzyMe">flattened exercise</a> to be really interesting. I found this interesting because for Assignment 3 my code was about 20 lines long. However in the lab I was able to get the same results using one line of code by using the reduce and concat method. This showed how important it is to know the higher order functions and array methods because they can make things a lot more efficient.</p>

<h1 id="what-explicit-tasks-eg-reading-were-you-given-during-this-lab">What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h1>

<p>First we had to read background information on JavaScript. This contained reading <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html">chapter 5</a> and <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html">chapter 6</a> from Eloquent JavaScript. Then we looked at array methods. In this part of the lab we focused on chapter 5 a lot. We looked at how JavaScript arrays have higher order methods. Then we worked on solving the flatten exercise using the methods <code>reduce</code> and <code>concat</code>. Then we looked at parsing through a json file using JavaScript. Here we wrote a function to find the information that is associated with a particular name that is passed in. Then we looked at methods in JavaScript.</p>

<h2>What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<p>In this lab working with 
 <b>JavaScript objects</b> was a new concept. It was interesting to see that the JavaScript objects were similar to the hash table in Racket. The next new concept was 
 <b>Deep Comparison</b>. This was a were we had to write a method to compare the values of the object's actual properties. The next new concept was 
 <b>JavaScript Arrays</b>. These were very similar to arrays that are used in Java.</p>

<h2>What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>In this lab there was not anything that was super familiar. The concept of JavaScript arrays were similar to those in Java. This helped made learning JavaScript arrays a lot easier to understand. Also having background knowledge of how arrays work too was very helpful to understand JavaScript arrays.</p>

<h2>What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>I practiced my coding skills in JavaScript. This was done by working with arrays in JavaScript and objects within JavaScript.  I also practiced my testing skills. This was done by working with jasmine in the lab to test the methods that have been created to make sure they actually worked.</p>

<h2>What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>I found how JavaScript concepts that were covered in today&rsquo;s lab was very similar to others languages we learnt in the past very interesting. It made understanding those concepts a lot easier.</p>

<h2>What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>First there were some background readings ton JavaScript and function arguments.  Then we moved on to 
 <b>JavaScript objects</b>. Here we did a quick reading on what <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html#h_cqg63Sxe3o">JavaScript</a> objects were. Then we moved to do a quick demonstrations about JavaScript objects.  Next topic covered was 
 <b>deep comparison</b>. We had to follow the deep comparison <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html#i_IJBU+aXOIC">exercise</a> from the following link.  Next topic covered was 
 <b>JavaScript arrays</b>. Here we read a section from the link on what the <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html#h_HjL/otjEJn">JavaScript arrays</a> were. Then we had some practice working with JavaScript arrays. we had to follow the steps to the sum of the range exercise to write a sum function that passes all the tests that were provided in the lab instructions. Finally we covered 
 <b>variadic functions</b>.</p>

<h2>What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<p>In this lab we continued looking JavaScript. This concepts covered in the lab was all new concept from me.</p>

<h3>JavaScript</h3>

<p>In this lab we looked at creating functions in JavaScript and using modules. This was an interesting section because it a lot of things were very similar to racket and java. Creating functions was very similar to the way they are done in java. Creating the modules were very similar to the way it was done in racket.</p>

<h3>Jasmine</h3>

<p>The next new thing we covered was jasmine. This is a unit testing tool that is used. This was a very interesting thing to cover because it is always nice to find other tools that can be used to help test the code.</p>

<h2>What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>There was nothing that was too familiar in this lab. The structure of JavaScript was familiar from racket and java. This familiar structure made it easier to gain a basic understanding of javascript.  I was also familiar with recursion from the past coding languages. Having the past knowledge made applying recursion in java script a lot easier to understand.</p>

<h2>What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>Some new skills I practiced was coding in JavaScript and testing through different tools.  The skills in JavaScript was practiced by having the whole lab be based on coding in Javascript.  The testing skills were practiced by using jasmine to run different test cases. What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important? I found the close similarities to Java and racket very interesting. It made the process of learning the new language a lot easier to begin.</p>

<h2>What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>First we looked at the 
 <b>JavaScript equality</b> and type coercion. During this we looked different statements that use <code>==</code> and looked at the results.  Then we looked at 
 <b>JavaScript functions</b>. We read <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html">JavaScript function</a> to help gain a better understanding of what they are.These are outlined very similar to the way the functions that are in Java which made it easier to understand.  After we looked at 
 <b>Node.js modules</b>. This was a very similar way of setting up modules as racket did. For this section we quickly read <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/10_modules.html">chapter 10</a> of the JavaScript book to gain a better understanding of modules in JavaScript. After we looked at Jasmine. First I read the <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/index.html">documentation</a> and the <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite">tutorial</a> to git better understanding of how the unit testing framework. Then we moved to testing to see how it worked with creating small simple unit test cases. FInally we looked at 
 <b>recursion in JavaScript</b>. This was a very similar to racket and Java.</p>

<h2>What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<p>This lab was mainly focused around JavaScript. JavaScript was a new language for me to learn today. In the lab it was really helpful to have the background knowledge of Java because it made things a lot easier to understand. It was also helpful knowing racket because there was a lot of shortcut ways of do things that you could not do in Java.   
 <h2>What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>  There was nothing that I knew from the past used that was used in this lab. However my knowledge of Java really helped to understand JavaScript a lot easier. It also helped me pick up on the JavaScript syntax.   
 <h2>What new skills did you practice?</h2> Some new skills I practiced today was using debugging in JavaScript. Another skill I practiced was coding in JavaScript. The skills I practiced today are going to become helpful throughout the course as we more more into JavaScript stuff.   
 <h2>What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2> In this lab, I found the 
 <b>VSCodium</b> really interesting. It seems like it would be very handy to debug the JavaScript in. I also found trying to solve the JavaScript problems really interesting. It was interesting to see the different ways that they could be solved.   
 <h2>What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2> In this lab we started working with JavaScript. First we started with understanding a little about JavaScript by reading a few different links posted in the lab. Then there was a demonstration on how to use VSCodium. During the demonstration we were also shown that in order to run JavaScript through the terminal, we use <code>node hello-world.js</code> . Then we used JavaScript to translate some Racket expressions. Then finally we looked at two coding problems in JavaScript.</p>

<h2>What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<h3>Macros</h3>

<p>In the lab we discussed the construction of programs using macros. To define a macro in racket we use <code>define-syntax-rule</code>. This is basically a function that does not evaluate the arguments. This seems like it would be helpful in a case where you want to evaluate math functions or different boolean statements.   
 <h3>Pattern Matching</h3> The next new thing that was covered in the lab was match. This is a function where you specify a pattern to match against the data instead of specifying a test for each case. This seems like a very helpful when using a pattern against a list.</p>

<h2>What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>There was not a lot of familiar concepts. The only concept that was a little familiar was using <code>Let</code> and <code>Let*</code>. The only reasons why these concepts where a little familiar is because we looked at them in a previous lab. They did not completely make sense until this lab.</p>

<h2>What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>During the lab there was not any new skills that I practiced. I practiced my problem solving skill in the lab. This was done by having to fill in the blanks in the code. This was done for part 4 of the <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/teaching/cs2613/labs/L07/">lab</a>.</p>

<h2>What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>Some of the things that I found really interesting is the lab was using <code>match</code>. This was really interesting to me because it was something I have not seen before. It was a cool concept to look at another way to use something similar to <code>cons</code> for lists.</p>

<h2>What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>The first thing we had to do in the lab is read a few links to get some background.  Then we looked at 
 <b>macros</b>. During this section we looked at redefining <code>and</code> and redefining <code>or</code>.  Then we looked at 
 <b>pattern matching</b>. Here we used match with maps and looked at <code>Let</code> and <code>Let *</code>.  Then we looked at 
 <b>list transformers to macros</b>. During this part of the lab we looked at reading a list in a macro.</p>

<h2>What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<h3>Explorer</h3>

<p>One of the new things that I learned this lab was the explorer. Using the explorer reminded me of using visual debuggers in other program languages. You were able to see what was in the list. This would allow you to be able to see what is stored in the list. I think this was a very interesting concept to learned because it seems like it would be a very helpful tool for debugging. Having a separate window open with the list of variables visible would be really helpful when trying to understand what the code is doing. Another thing I learned to go with has tables is the function this which allows you to print out what you have highlighted in the explorer.</p>

<h3>Plotting</h3>

<p>Plotting was another new thing I learned in the lab today. This concept would be helpful for unit test cases to be able to check the behaviour of the code. The plotting is also useful for watching specific variables change as you change other variables. I feel that plotting would also be good for testing where the output is defined by the input.</p>

<h3>Hash Table functions</h3>

<p>Before the lab I had a familiar sense of <code>Hash Tables</code> from other programming languages but during the lab I learned a lot of new functions that Racket uses. The first interesting thing found was that the period on <code>define (census . list)</code> means that it takes all the inputs and combines them into a list. This seems like a really interesting and helpful tool to use when it comes to doing assignments.</p>

<h2>What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<p>Before the lab I had some knowledge on 
 <b>hash tables</b> from other programming languages. This helped make things click a lot faster and understand what the different functions could do.</p>

<h2>What new skills did you practice?</h2>

<p>The skills that I got to practice during this lab was my debugging skills. More importantly I got to practice using tools to be able to understand the behaviour of the code.  I also got to practice working with tail recursion and cons.</p>

<h2>What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab?</h2>

<p>First we worked with hash tables. We had to fill in the accumulator in the code that was provided in the lab instructions.  Then we moved to work with explorer and ran a few different commands to see how it worked.  After we worked with plotting. In this section we had to plot the difference between <code>(deriv sin x)</code> and <code>(cos x)</code>.  Finally we moved to work with JSON and writing a function to collect all the statuses from the <code>errors.json</code> file.</p>

<h2>What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?</h2>

<h3>Trail Recursion</h3>

<p>Trail recursion<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/Lists__Iteration__and_Recursion.html#%28part._tail-recursion%29">Trail recursion</a> was an interesting concept to look at. At the beginning it was a little changeling to understand the question that was being asked. after looking at the trail recursion document and reading it through a few times it seemed to make more sense and the question became a lot easier to answer. The example on the document was really helpful for part 1 of the lab.</p>

<h3>For Loops</h3>

<p>The other new concept we looked at today was <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/for.html">for loops</a>. These were pretty easy to understand because they looked a lot like the for loops in java. Understand the different types of for loops like for/fold was a bit tricky. The documentation explained it really well.</p>

<h2>What concepts are familiar from other courses or from your own knowledge?</h2>

<h3>For Loop</h3>

<p>The for concept was a little familiar from Java and previous languages. Learning the syntax and different types were new tho. Having a base understanding of four loops made it a lot easier to understand them in Racket.</p>

<h3>Range</h3>

<p>Today in one of the code examples on the lab there was a function called range used. This was familiar to be because I used it on the assignment which I finished before the lab. Knowing range before had helped me understand what the code was doing a lot easier.</p>

<h2>What specific details did you find surprising, interesting, confusing, difficult, or otherwise important?</h2>

<p>I found the trail recursion very interesting today. It was interesting because it was a new concept but it also makes sense in practice. Being able to increment as you go is really helpful to know because it can help save stack on the stack trace and it makes things a lot faster to run.</p>

<h2>What explicit tasks (e.g. reading) were you given during this lab</h2>

<p>First we copy the code provided in part 1 and observed how deep the stack trace went. Then we copied the code for odds-even2 and fixed the helper function to use trail recursion. Then we looked at for loop. We copied the code odds-even3 that used for loops instead of recursion. We then copied the function big-list to be able to compare the speeds between the three different functions. It turns out the odds-even2 was the fastest.  For part 4 we gained more practice working with trail recursion, for loops and higher order functions.</p>
